## Interpreter

Then cd in this folder run `make go`

The compiled interpreter binary will be in `./src/out/interpreter` (with .exe if is Windows)

Then directly run the binary.

## IDLE

If you want to work with the GUI editor, ensure you have installed the proper gtk (instruction available in README.md)

Then run `make gui`. The compiled GUI editor will be in `./src/out/idle` (with .exe if is Windows)

If you are using macOS, run `make macPack` to pack the binary as a macOS app.
