# Define a variable

What is a variable? Try think about when you doing math, there must be some intermediate variables to store the numbers (results), right? In programming, a variable is a container to store data. You can think of it as a box that holds a value. The value can be a number, a string, a list, or any other data type.

In K, define a variable is simple. If you want to define a variable called `x` and assign a value `10` to it, you can write:

```k
x = 18
```

The `=` is the assignment operator. It assigns the value on the right to the variable on the left. In this case, the value `18` is assigned to the variable `x`.
